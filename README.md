## Heart Disease Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical features. Includes EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset(s) used for training and testing
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, preprocessing, and model experimentation
- `models/`: Trained ML models saved for reuse
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization
  - `preprocessing.py`: Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - `model_training.py`: Training machine learning models
  - `model_evaluation.py`: Evaluation of trained models
  - `model_utils.py`: Utility functions for ML workflow
  - `visualisation.py`: Functions for generating plots and figures
- `reports/`: Project outputs and reports
  - `figures/`: Visualization images (e.g., distributions, heatmaps, pairplots)
  - `metrics/`: Evaluation and tuning results (e.g., `tuning_results.json`)
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies to install
- `README.md`: Project documentation
