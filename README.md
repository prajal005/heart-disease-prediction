Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project applies data analysis and machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
It uses the Heart Disease dataset (heart.csv) derived from the Kaggle dataset "Heart Disease Dataset
" kaggle.com


 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 1,025 patient records with 14 medical attributes used to predict heart disease.

Key Statistics:

Age: 29 – 77 years (mean ≈ 54.4)

Cholesterol: 126 – 564 mg/dl (mean ≈ 246)

Resting Blood Pressure: 94 – 200 mm Hg (mean ≈ 132)

Maximum Heart Rate (thalach): 71 – 202 bpm (mean ≈ 149)

Oldpeak (ST depression): 0 – 6.2 (mean ≈ 1.07)

Features include:

age → Age of patient

sex → Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp → Chest pain type (0–3)

trestbps → Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)

chol → Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)

fbs → Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)

restecg → Resting electrocardiographic results (0–2)

thalach → Maximum heart rate achieved

exang → Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

oldpeak → ST depression induced by exercise

slope → Slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca → Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy

thal → Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)

target → Presence of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

 Conclusion & Future Work

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data.

 The tuned Logistic Regression model achieved 87.6% accuracy, with strong precision and recall scores.
 The model highlights important health attributes like chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate as strong predictors.

Future Improvements:

Experiment with deep learning approaches (e.g., Neural Networks).

Perform feature engineering to capture more complex interactions.

Deploy the model as a web application or API for real-world usability.
